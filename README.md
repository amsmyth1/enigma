# enigma
2011BE Mod1 - Final Project

Monday 5pm Evaluation Rubric

### Functionality - 3
- Enigmal class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented.
- Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented
- The crack method was something considered, but logically could not wrap my head around it. So no code for 4.

### Object Oriented Programming - 3.5
- Some classes are a little short, in particular I would combine encrption/decrpytion classes with enigma or eachother on the next iteration of Enigma.
- There was logicl breakdown and flow of information. Module was used.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 3.75
- Code is readable, logical, and managable
- All methods are under 8 lines
- All classes are under 100 lines
- Most enumerables are best for the case
- Class names could be better (-0.25)

### Test Driven Development - 2.75
- Test coverage metrics are at 100%
- Edge cases are accounted for

### Version Control - 3.5
- over 70 commits
- beginning of project did not use branch for first 4 commits


TO DO =
- [x] Add more tests for edge cases
- [x] Rename user_input class to user_info_transfer
- [ ] merge decrpytion and encryption?
